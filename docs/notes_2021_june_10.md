- get feedback on the course skeleton I sent (attached)

- get an update on the different OCESE initiatives going on related to 
340 ( modtran, the cmip6 dashboard?)

- better understand how we can connect all of the climate courses at 
EOAS, how they fit together, how they responds to different needs from 
different styles of students, and how they fit with the vision of the 
climate credential.

- for instance, should we try to make 340 and 3xx have almost the same 
learning goals, with one being more mathy, or should we try to make them 
as different and complementary as possible, because students may want to 
take both?

With all this, I'll update the course skeleton, and will need to discuss 
potential clasroom activities using dashboards, and how we can implement 
that into large 100+ student course, we may or may not have time to get 
to that point.
